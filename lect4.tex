The dispersion has minimum and maximum. We can interval of allowed frequencies ''band`` and its size is called ''bandwidth``. 
The dispersion is periodic with period of $\frac{2\pi}{a}$, since the system is symmetric to translations of $a$.

\paragraph{Solutions of the equations}
Since translation operator commutes with Hamiltonian, the eigenfunctions of Hamiltonian got to be eigenfunctions of the translation operator, which are
$$u_N = A e^{i\omega t - ikna}$$
\subsection{Reciprocal lattice}
\paragraph{Reciprocal space}
Space of wavenumbers. We found equivalent points in inverse space. We call all the points equivalent to $k=0$ reciprocal lattice, i.e., $k=\frac{2\pi}{a} p$ for $p \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\paragraph{First Brillouin zone}
is a unit cell centered in $k=0$.
\paragraph{Finite system}
If the system is finite with size $L$,
$$e^{ik na} = e^{ik \qty(n+\frac{L}{a})a}$$
Thus
$$k=\frac{2\pi}{L} \cdot p$$

i.e., the number of modes
$$N_{modes} = \frac{\frac{2\pi}{a}}{\frac{2\pi}{L}} = \frac{L}{a} = N_{atoms}$$

\paragraph{Properties of dispersion}
\subparagraph{Sound waves}
$$\omega(k) \approx \sqrt{\frac{K}{m}} \abs{k}a = v\abs{k}$$
\subparagraph{Short wavelengths}
$$k \approx \frac{\pi}{a}$$
\subparagraph{Velocity}
$$v_{group} = \dv{\omega}{k}$$
$$v_{phase} = \frac{\omega}{k}$$

\subsection{Quantized phonons }
We quantize our oscillator , with energy
$$E_N =\hbar \omega \qty(n+\frac{1}{2})$$
\paragraph{Crystal momentum}
We define crystal momentum, momentum modulo $\hbar\frac{2\pi}{a}$. Since the lattice can give or take momentum in portions $\hbar\frac{2\pi}{a}$.
\subsection{Two-atom chain of atoms}
Suppose we have two types of atoms, $x$ and $y$, with locations
$$x_n  = na+\frac{a}{10}$$
$$y_n  = na+\frac{8a}{10}$$
Suppose $m_1=m_2$ but $k_1\neq k_2$, ($_2$ connects $x_n$ with $y_n$ and $k_2$ connects $y_n$ with $x_{n+1}$).
$$\delta \ddot{x}_n = k_2(\delta y_n - \delta x_n) + k_1(\delta y_{n-1} - \delta x_n)$$
$$\delta \ddot{x}_n =k_1(\delta x_{n+1} - \delta y_{n}) + k_2(\delta x_n - \delta y_n ) $$
