\section{Introduction}
Phase are distinguished by symmetries, e.g., liquid and solid have difference in transnational symmetry. Those phase transitions happens together with spontaneous symmetry breakage.For example, magnet ''chooses`` poles when transits to magnetic phase.
\subsection{Heat capacity}
Most of matereals have $C=3k_B$, except diamond in room temperature and pressure. In low temperatures though, materials have $C=\alpha T + \gamma T^3$. Thus, most of materials get to saturation in room temperature, while diamond doesn't.
